the values at t7 and t9 are never updated, and so on the loop goes on for ever and we never get to jump to label 9.
this is porbably caused by the fact that we change the registers of each variable. that shouldn't happen!
or polly because the values in the stack is not updated

- Update:
seems like the problem is in the second loop.
