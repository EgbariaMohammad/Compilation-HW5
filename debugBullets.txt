the values at t7 and t9 are never updated, and so on the loop goes on for ever and we never get to jump to label 9.
this is porbably caused by the fact that we change the registers of each variable. that shouldn't happen!
or polly because the values in the stack is not updated

- Update:
seems like the problem is in the second loop.

- Update:
    note that if we remove the first blok and keep the while in the global block, the code works, print only one but it works,
    seems like the problem is in the while derivatin rule.
    first problem is that we break out of both loops! when we need to break only the one we're in.!
