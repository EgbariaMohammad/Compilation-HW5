The values at t7 and t9 are never updated, and so the loop goes on forever and we never get to jump to label 9.
This is probably caused by the fact that we change the registers of each variable. That shouldn't happen!
Or possibly because the values in the stack are not updated.

- Update:
Seems like the problem is in the second loop.

- Update:
    Note that if we remove the first block and keep the while in the global block, the code works, prints only one but it works,
    seems like the problem is in the while derivation rule.
    The first problem is that we break out of both loops! When we need to break only the one we're in.!

- Update:
    Note that the index variable is being saved in the stack where MaxFibNumberToPrint is saved!!!
    %t17 = getelementptr [50 x i32], [50 x i32]* %stack_ptr, i32 0, i32 3
    store i32 0, i32* %t17
    But in this address we previously saved MaxFibNumberToPrint!
    %t2= add i32 20,0
    %t3 = getelementptr [50 x i32], [50 x i32]* %stack_ptr, i32 0, i32 3
    store i32 %t2, i32* %t3

- FINAL Update:
The problem is in the offset counter! When opening a new block, I reset it back to zero for the current block, when I should keep on incrementing it!
